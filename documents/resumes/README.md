# My resumes

Here, you'll find my CVs!

There's two different folders:

1. [latest], my latest CVs (moust updated)
2. [all], all my CVs (with dates)

[latest]: https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.documents/tree/main/documents/resumes/latest
[all]: https://github.com/nasccped/nascc.documents/tree/main/documents/resumes/all

## About files

I have two versions for each CV file:

- `english` (globally accepted language)
- `portuguese-Brazil` (my native language)

You can choose what you prefer!

### Date reading (all CVs)

In order to make my CVs more organized, I'll name them all using the following
schema:

> `resume-<YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>.<LANGUAGE>.pdf`

Since latest CVs are, well... the latest, they don't need a date.
