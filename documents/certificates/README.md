# My certificates

Welcome to my certificates folder! All files here (except `README.md`) are
certificate related.

The certificate file name format will follow this schema:

> `AAA-BBB.CCC`

Where:
- `AAA` means the certificate original title (standar idiom) in [kebabe case]
  (hyphen separated).
- `BBB` means the program durantion (`5hrs`, `2weeks`, ...).
- `CCC` means the file extension (commonly `pdf`).

[kebabe case]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case
